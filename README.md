# FilesWithAngular.NET
Created a user interface to manage file details and track processing status, including upload and processing timestamps. Developed an algorithm prioritizing file processing based on SLA criteria such as priority and processing time. Implemented real-time updates for file status (uploaded, processed, pending) in the UI.
