# Files With Angular.NET

We are designing a solution for a customer file processing system. This system processes files uploaded by various customers, with each customer having a fixed Service Level Agreement (SLA) for file processing. It takes 1 minute for the system to process a file. The SLAs are categorized as follows:

SLA 1: 30 minutes
SLA 2: 60 minutes
SLA 3: Best effort (within 24 hours)

We are not required to implement the actual file upload and storage process, but you can use file metadata to simulate the uploaded and processed statuses.
Create a user interface to manage file details and track processing status, including upload and processing timestamps. Develop an algorithm prioritizing file processing based on SLA criteria such as priority and processing time. Implement real-time updates for file status (uploaded, processed, pending) in the UI.
